#### > Establishing new baseline for marine biodiversity knowledge with modern technologies

<!-- we can speed up greatly how much we study and use technology to identify interesting problems -->

#### > How can we speed up the documentation of biodiversity?

<!-- many basic questions: how many species? where do species live? can we tell them apart? very difficult to answer -->

# Accelerating Biodiversity Documentation

---

## What do we know about marine biodiversity in the US?

* Analyze 3+ million occurrence records from biodiversity databases
* First data synthesis on marine invertebrates at this scale
