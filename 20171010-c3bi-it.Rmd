## R packages

for phylogenetic data

---
# R package: `phylobase`

* Data structure for comparative methods
* Tree and associated data in a single object

```{r}
library(phylobase)
head(geospiza, n = 4)
```

---
# R package: `rncl`

* Wrapper around the NEXUS Class Library
* Robust parsing of NEXUS and Newick files

# R package: `cipresr`

* Send data and parameters to CIPRES Science Gateway for phylogenetic analysis

---
# R package: `rotl`

* Use the Open Tree of Life API
* Link with other R packages for phylogenetic data

```{r, echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
library(rotl)
taxa <- tnrs_match_names(names =
            c("Chlamydomonas reinhardtii",
              "Drosophila melanogaster", "Arabidopsis thaliana",
               "Rattus norvegicus", "Mus musculus",
               "Cavia porcellus", "Xenopus laevis",
               "Saccharomyces cervisae", "Danio rerio"))
tr <- tol_induced_subtree(ott_id(taxa))
```
